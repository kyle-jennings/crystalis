## Current Session Development Log

### Dev Mode Player Position Display
**Request**: "When in dev mode, I want the display the current position coordinates of the player. These should be displayed within the new dev panel"  
**Time**: July 23, 2025  
**Files Modified**:
- `js/classes/DevMode.js` - Enhanced `updateDevPanel()` method to prominently display player coordinates

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added dedicated "Player Position" section in dev panel
- Real-time X/Y coordinate display with `Math.round()` for clean integer values
- Formatted with clear labeling and proper spacing
- Updates continuously as player moves around game world

**Features Added**:
- **Real-time Coordinates**: Updates every frame in game loop
- **Clean Display**: Rounded integer values instead of floating-point decimals
- **Prominent Placement**: Dedicated section at top of dev panel
- **Clear Formatting**: Easy-to-read layout with proper indentation

**Gameplay Impact**:
- Essential debugging tool for level design and collision detection
- Enables precise positioning of objects and boundaries
- Useful for understanding player movement and world coordinates

### Canvas Details Display Enhancement
**Request**: "display the following canvas details for the current level: canvasWidth, canvasHeight, width, height, worldWidth, worldHeight"  
**Time**: July 23, 2025  
**Files Modified**:
- `js/classes/DevMode.js` - Added comprehensive canvas configuration display

**Technical Implementation**:
- Retrieves canvas configs from `currentLevelObj.canvasConfigs`
- Displays all six canvas dimension properties
- Shows fallback values when configs aren't available
- Real-time updates when switching between levels

**Canvas Details Displayed**:
- **Canvas Size**: HTML canvas element dimensions (canvasWidth x canvasHeight)
- **Level Dimensions**: Game logic width and height
- **World Size**: Complete world boundaries (worldWidth x worldHeight)

**Gameplay Impact**:
- Critical for debugging level transitions and camera behavior
- Helps understand relationship between canvas size and world size
- Useful for verifying dynamic canvas resizing works properly
- Essential for level design and boundary testing

### File Rename and Import Path Updates
**Request**: "please rename the 'crystalis-game.js' file to 'index.js' and change any import paths to reflect this name change"  
**Time**: July 23, 2025  
**Files Modified**:
- `js/crystalis-game.js` → `js/index.js` (renamed)
- `index.html` - Updated script import path from `./js/crystalis-game.js` to `./js/index.js`

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used `mv` command to rename main game file
- Updated HTML script tag to reference new filename
- No internal JavaScript imports needed updating (modules import from this file, not to it)
- Maintained all functionality while improving file naming convention

**Benefits**:
- **Cleaner Structure**: `index.js` is more conventional for main entry point
- **Better Organization**: Aligns with standard JavaScript project conventions
- **No Functionality Changes**: Pure refactoring with no behavioral impact

### Dynamic World Boundaries for Player Movement
**Request**: "These numbers are wrong and should be dynamically set when the level changes. For instance, 1016 was the former world width but levels 2 and 3 are set to 1024. Level 1 one has a world width of 540. Please adjust this so the player object has access to the current canvas size"  
**Time**: July 23, 2025  
**Files Modified**:
- `js/classes/Player.js` - Modified `move()` method to accept dynamic world boundaries
- `js/index.js` - Updated all `player.move()` calls to pass current world dimensions

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Player.move() Enhancement**: Added `worldWidth` and `worldHeight` parameters with defaults
- **Dynamic Boundary Calculation**: `Math.max(8, Math.min(x, worldWidth - width - 8))`
- **Game Integration**: All movement calls now pass `this.worldWidth` and `this.worldHeight`
- **Collision Handling**: Updated both normal movement and collision recovery to use dynamic boundaries

**Boundary System**:
- **Level 1 (Village)**: 540x566 world → Player boundaries: 8 to 516 (x), 8 to 542 (y)
- **Level 2 (Forest)**: 1024x768 world → Player boundaries: 8 to 1000 (x), 8 to 744 (y)
- **Level 3 (Cave)**: 1024x768 world → Player boundaries: 8 to 1000 (x), 8 to 744 (y)

**Gameplay Impact**:
- **Accurate Boundaries**: Player can no longer move outside actual level boundaries
- **Per-Level Adaptation**: Boundaries automatically adjust when switching levels
- **Consistent Buffer**: 8-pixel buffer maintained across all levels
- **Collision Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing collision system

### Level Editor Implementation
**Request**: "I think it would be a good idea to have a simple level editor... Can you walk me through the steps you would take to accomplish this"  
**Time**: July 23, 2025

**Comprehensive Implementation Plan Executed**:

#### Step 1: LevelEditor Class Creation
**File**: `js/classes/LevelEditor.js`
- **Object Placement System**: Click-to-place, right-click-to-remove
- **Tool Selection**: Trees, mountains, houses, walls, experience orbs
- **Visual Features**: Grid overlay, selection boxes, object highlighting
- **Export Functionality**: Save edited levels as JSON files

#### Step 2: HTML Structure Enhancement
**File**: `index.html`
- **Dual Canvas Layout**: Game canvas and editor canvas side-by-side
- **Flexbox Container**: `#mainFlexWrapper` with gap spacing
- **Editor UI**: Tool palette and controls overlay

#### Step 3: DevMode Integration
**File**: `js/classes/DevMode.js`
- **Tab System**: Debug/Editor tabs in dev panel
- **Editor Toggle**: E key to activate/deactivate editor
- **Tool Palette UI**: Dynamic object selection buttons
- **State Management**: Track editor mode and selected tools

#### Step 4: Game Loop Integration
**File**: `js/index.js`
- **Editor Mode Detection**: Conditional game updates
- **Frozen Game State**: No player movement, effects, or enemy AI during editing
- **Dual Rendering**: Game canvas + editor canvas simultaneously
- **Limited Updates**: Only essential systems run in editor mode

#### Step 5: CSS Styling
**File**: `styles.css`
- **Editor Container**: Styling for secondary canvas
- **Object Palette**: Grid layout with hover effects
- **Tab System**: Active/inactive states
- **Visual Polish**: Selection indicators and tool feedback

**Level Editor Features**:
- **Real-time Editing**: See changes immediately on editor canvas
- **Tool Palette**: Visual selection of placeable objects
- **Grid System**: 32px grid overlay for precise placement

- **Frozen Game**: No distractions during editing

**Usage Instructions**:
1. **Enable Dev Mode**: Ensure `.devmode` file exists
2. **Activate Editor**: Press **E key** or click **Editor tab**
3. **Select Tools**: Click objects in palette (tree, mountain, house, etc.)
4. **Place Objects**: Left-click on editor canvas
5. **Remove Objects**: Right-click near objects
6. **Export Level**: Click "Export Level" button

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Modular Design**: Separate LevelEditor class for clean separation
- **Event System**: Canvas click/context menu handlers
- **Camera Sync**: Editor camera follows game camera
- **Object Detection**: Distance-based removal system
- **Visual Feedback**: Selection boxes and tool indicators

**Gameplay Impact**:
- **Level Design Tool**: Create and modify levels visually
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Test level layouts immediately
- **Content Creation**: Expand game with new level designs
- **Debugging Aid**: Precise object placement for testing
- **Export/Import**: Share level designs as JSON files
